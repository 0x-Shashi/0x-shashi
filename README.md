<summary><strong>About me</strong></summary>

<br/>

I have completed my Computer Science degree from Presidency University, Bengaluru, and have been working with Netrum Labs for the past 10 months.

As an early-stage startup, there is no fixed role. I work on whatever is required at the moment, spanning development, experimentation, and execution across different areas.

From a coding perspective, I still consider myself a beginner, but my goal is to become a complete developer before Q2 2026.

At the moment, I am not actively looking for jobs and have intentionally paused that path to focus on learning, building, and strengthening my fundamentals.
